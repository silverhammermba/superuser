You might have noticed that there has been a bit of a gap in the book so far. In
part 1 we learned about how computers work at a very fundamental, theoretical
level, and in part 2 we talked about how the Internet works at a very
conceptual, high level. But none of those chapters really explained how the
computers we use every day work. This part of the book will hopefully fill that
gap.

In part 1 we learned how a computer is a machine that performs a computation
using instructions called a program. But this description is nothing like what
we're used to. We're used to computers that run many programs at once: web
browsers, music players, image viewers, word processors, games, etc. We can
access information on our computers using thumb drives, DVDs, and the Internet.
Our computers can be "hacked" and get viruses. What does any of that have to do
with a single list of instructions? How does a computation get a virus?

Believe it or not, I didn't lie to you. Our computers (technically) only run a
single program and perform one single computation when we turn them on. And they
share this trait will all computers going back to the very first ones. In fact
the first computers were very similar to the ones we learned about in part 1.
Computer scientists would often spend hours or days carefully planning out a
program for a computer then they would feed it into the computer, switch it on,
and wait patiently for it to spit out the final result.
