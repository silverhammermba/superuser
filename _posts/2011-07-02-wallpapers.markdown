title: (BONUS) Digital vs. Analog
category: part1
---

All of that digital/analog/discrete/continuous stuff we learned in the
formatting chapter might have been a little too abstract. Let's break it down
with a real hands-on example.

This chapter uses a lot of precisely designed images to demonstrate certain
concepts. Mobile devices viewing this chapter will sometimes display these
images differently than I intended, which kind of defeats the point! If
possible, read this chapter using a (non-mobile) computer.

## Wallpapers ##

Most computers these days have the concept of a "desktop": a main workspace
where you can store files or links to programs, and which is covered up by
the program windows you open (such as the web browser you are reading this in).

And all of these desktops have a pretty image for you to look at when you have
no windows open. These images are often called "desktop backgrounds" or
"wallpapers". You've probably seen some of the [default wallpapers][wall] that
come with popular computers. Kind of like your outfit at an interview, your
desktop wallpaper is one of the first things people will notice about your
computer and it says a lot about what kind of user you are. In fact, you can
usually quickly tell whether someone is _not_ a superuser just by looking at
their wallpaper. How? Well, surprisingly, it all has to do with that digital vs.
analog trickiness.

## Images ##

Last chapter I mentioned how monitors display images using pixels. Pixels are a
purely **digital** concept: you can count the number of pixels on your monitor,
and you can't have half a pixel. Similarly each pixel can only display a certain
number of colors, and there are certain colors that they can't reproduce
exactly. However, we usually use monitors to convey **analog** information: our
eyes can't easily distinguish between tiny pixels or tiny variations in digital
color, so we perceive smooth images with smooth colors.

Understanding the difference between digital and analog is essential for having
a good-looking desktop wallpaper, and a trained eye can easily pick out when a
digital image is not being properly displayed on a monitor.

![normal flower]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower.png)
{: .pull-right}

For this chapter, we're going to use an image of a flower as an example. This
image is made of a grid of 158,464 pixels - 128 on each side. On the right is a
portion of the image zoomed in 4&times; so that you can clearly see the pixels. Now
suppose that we want to use this image as our desktop background. The desktop
displayed on your monitor is also a digital image measured in pixels, so our
challenge is to fit the pixels of the flower into the pixels of the desktop.

The easiest case would be if our desktop's resolution is also 128&times;128.

The **resolution** of a digital image is its size measured in pixels, usually
written _width_&times;_height_.
{: .definition}

In that case &ndash; where the image and the desktop are the same size &ndash;
we can simply place each pixel of the image into the corresponding pixel of the
desktop. The image will look exactly the same on the desktop as it did on its
own. But what if the image and the desktop are not the same size?

## Resizing ##

![cropped flower]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower_crop.png)
{: .pull-right}

For example, what if the desktop is too small? We could simply _crop_ the image
- remove the pixels that don't fit on the desktop. We'll lose some information,
but the pixels that _are_ shown on the desktop will be displayed exactly as they
were in the original image. This is usually the best option if it still looks
good. But what if the desktop is _much_ smaller? What if the desktop is so small
that cropping the image would make it look unappealing, thus defeating the point
of a desktop wallpaper?

![flower fit]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower_grid.png)
{: .pull-left}

To solve this problem, we need to resize the image to fit the desktop. But this
can be surprisingly tricky. To illustrate why, let's look at just a tiny portion
of the original flower image: a 4&times;4 square. And let's suppose that our
desktop is only 3&times;3. That means we need to somehow turn 16 pixels into 9
pixels. There isn't a clear "best" approach to solving this problem. For
example, one approach is to simply pick the 9 pixels in the image that are
closest to the position of the pixels on the desktop (for, example the 9 pixels
marked with Xs in the image on the left). This "nearest-neighbor" approach to
resizing has some advantages: the pixel colors in the resulting 3&times;3 image
exactly match colors from the original image and it's very easy to resize images
in this way. However it does have a disadvantage: it simply discards some
pixels, which could leave out important details from the original.

{: .pull-right}

![worst-case resizing]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower_worst.png)
{: .pull-right}

Other image resizing algorithms try to "sample" or "filter" the image, meaning
they combine information from several pixels to produce each individual pixel in
the result. On the right, we see the flower image resized with three different
algorithms (and then zoomed in again to see the individual pixels). Notice how
they differ in terms of the pixel colors, which details are most visible, how
blurry certain parts appear. For a more extreme example of how tricky image
resizing can be, look at the image below it.

[This article][magick] explains image filters and resizing in (a lot) more
detail.
{: .deeper}

[magick]: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/

On the top row, we have three different images: a mostly black region with
a few white pixels, a crude smiley face, and some curved lines. The rows below
that show these three images resized using the same three algorithms we used on
the flower image above (and again zoomed in to see the pixels). The first
resized example uses nearest neighbor. Notice how it turned the mostly black
region completely white! Remember that nearest neighbor only picks one pixel from
the original image for each pixel in the result; in this case it picked only the
white pixels even though most of the original pixels are black! The smiley face
is also completely unrecognizable, again since it didn't make "good" choices of
pixels. The next algorithm &ndash; called a bilinear filter &ndash; does a bit
better: the mostly black region is still mostly black, and the smiley face is
closer but still not quite recognizable. Lastly, the Fant algorithm does a great
job of preserving both the mostly black region and the smiley face. But what
about those rings?

An **artifact** is an unintentional (and usually undesirable) property in the
output of a computation.
{: .definition}

In this case, none of these algorithms _intend_ to create rings when resizing an
image of curved lines: the rings are an artifact (specifically a [moir√©
pattern][moire]). But the real lesson here is that it's virtually impossible to
find an image resizing algorithm that works well in all cases. When we humans
look at an image, we see _content_: things like curved lines and a smiley face.
But a computer just sees pixels. It's very hard to come up with an algorithm
that manipulates pixels while preserving whatever content they may represent.

[moire]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern

One approach to content-preserving image resizing is called [seam carving][seam]
or [liquid rescaling][lqr]. It tries to identify important areas of the image
and then only removes the least important pixels when shrinking the image.

### Crop & Resize ###

![cropping and resizing]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower_smallcrop.png)
{: .pull-left}

Now for a slight twist: suppose we want to fit our 128&times;128 flower on an
80&times;56 desktop. Cropping the image would discard too much, so we just
resize... right? **WRONG!** Our original image is square, but 80&times;56 is
not. Simply resizing the image to the desired size would destroy the image's
aspect ratio.

The **aspect ratio** of a digital image is the ratio _width_:_height_.
{: .definition}

The result of blindly resizing is the squished-looking flower on the left. Its
natural symmetry has been ruined! The trick is to resize the 128&times;128 image
to 80&times;80 _first_ and then crop to 80&times;56. This preserves the aspect
ratio while also not removing too much during the crop.

### Enlarging ###

![cropping and resizing]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower_enlarge.png)
{: .pull-right}

Now what if the image we want for our desktop is too small? We could resize it
to be larger: all of the previously discussed algorithms can both shrink and
enlarge images. But there is a pretty big difference in this situation.
Previously, when shrinking an image, the challenge was how to fit the
information from a lot of pixels into a few pixels. You could think of shrinking
an image as _summarizing_ an image. Suppose someone told you to summarize a
story so that it's the same story and about half as long. Tricky but doable,
right? Now suppose someone told you to expand a story so that it's the same
story but twice as long. Way, way harder, right? What additional information do
you insert?

Summarizing information while keeping the same content is much simpler than
adding information while keeping the same content, and this is reflected in
image resizing algorithms. On the right, there are a few examples of a portion
of the flower image enlarged to twice its original size. Take a moment to
examine them and pick out which one looks the best.

Which one did you choose? Hopefully the third one &ndash; if not you should go
back and look more carefully. The others look blocky or blurry, right? Compared
to the third one they almost make your eyes hurt, like your monitor is out of
focus or something. Well, guess what: all of the images are enlarged _except_
for the third one! That one is just a cropped higher-resolution image of the
flower! The lesson here is that if you need a bigger image, find an image that
was big to begin with! Don't resize a smaller image. Only in [rare cases][pix]
or when the enlargement is very subtle (like if your wallpaper is just a few
pixels too small) will the visual quality not be ruined by enlarging.

[pix]: http://www.deviantart.com/browse/undiscovered/digitalart/pixelart/

A completely different approach to digital images that avoids this enlarging
problem is [vector graphics][vector]. Instead of encoding images using pixels,
vector graphics encode images using shapes described by mathematical formulae.
These shapes can then be drawn using pixels at whatever scale is desired.
{: .deeper}

## Compression ##

The most common image formats these days use 24 bits (3 bytes) to store a single
color. Since each pixel of an image can be a different color, the size of a
digital image in bytes is just _width_&times;_height_&times;3. One of the most
common resolutions for a computer monitor these days is 1920&times;1080, meaning
that most desktop wallpapers are going to take up 1920&times;1080&times;3=6MB of
space on your hard drive (remember that's megabytes i.e. over 6 million bytes).
That's actually a pretty hefty size for just an image, so do we _really_ need
all 6 million bytes?

An image stored as a simple list of colored pixels is called a **bitmap**.
Bitmaps are commonly used behind the scenes in computers to manipulate and
display images, but they are unpopular for image storage due to their large
size.
{: .definition}

Suppose that you want to use a silly wallpaper that is just plain red. Every
pixel is the exact same shade. To store that image as a bitmap, you simply store
each red pixel. As a digital description of the image, that's kind of like
saying "The pixel in the top left corner is red, and the one next to it is red,
and the one next to that is red, and the one... and the leftmost pixel in the next
row is red, and the one next to it is red, and..." It's a bit silly, right?
Why not just say "All 6 million pixels are red"? This is a good example of where
_compression_ is useful.

**Compression** is any method of reducing the amount of data required to store
the same amount of information.
{: .definition}

For our example, we can imagine a [format][fm] as follows: if the first byte of
the data is 00, then we simply store the image as a bitmap; if the first byte of
the data is 01, then we list just one color and all pixels of the image are that
color. For our all-red image, we can encode it two different ways using this
format: with the first byte being 00 or the first byte being 01. The former
would require 6MB as before, but the latter would require only 4 bytes! That's a
huge reduction in size!

[fm]: {{ site.baseurl }}/part1/formatting/

Of course this is a very simplified example. Our image is particularly easy to
compress, and our format for compressing it is especially designed to handle it
well. However there are general image compression formats (such as PNG)
that can offer significant data savings for a wide variety of images. And they
work in roughly the same way as our simple algorithm: they find patterns in the
image data that can be described more efficiently than by just listing each
pixel's color.

### Loss ###

So what does compression have to do with choosing a nice desktop background?
Well, I made a little lie earlier. I said that compression stores the _same_
amount of information with fewer data, but the truth is a bit fuzzier. Remember
that although computer images are stored digitally, they often represent analog
information (like photographs of real objects). Since we interpret analog
information using our imperfect brains and sensory organs, there's actually
quite a lot of wiggle room when it comes to storing the "same" amount of
information.

![subtle color differences]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower_mod.png)
{: .pull-right}

For example, take a look at the images on the right. What differences do you
see? Really there is no difference as far as we humans are concerned, but a
computer would see the two as completely different - I subtly altered every
single pixel of the original image.

If our eyes are not sensitive enough to distinguish between two very similar
digital colors as in this case, why bother storing them as different colors at
all? In other words, why not removing subtle information that we can't see by
replacing similar colors with just one color? Compressing in this way - by
removing unimportant information - is called "lossy" compression and it usually
offers even greater savings of data size than the previous "lossless"
compression. JPEG (or JPG) is a common lossy image compression format.

With a lossless compression algorithm, there isn't much choice involved: all of
the information must be preserved, so the algorithm will simply compress the
image as much as it can. Lossy compression is different. Since it works by
removing information, most lossy compression algorithms offer a choice of how
much information to remove in order to compress the image. However this choice
can make lossy compression dangerous. It can be notoriously difficult to find
the "right" level of compression which achieves a good balance between reduced
size and image quality. Many programs take a naive approach and simply compress
all images equally - which is guaranteed to result in artifacts in certain
cases. Again, it comes down to computers not understanding image content as we
humans do. It takes a human eye to determine what level of compression is
correct.

![the effects of increased compression]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/flower_comp.png)
{: .pull-left}

On the left we see the flower image compressed three times with different
degrees of compression. The original uncompressed image takes up
128&times;128&times;3=49KB. The leftmost compressed image is nearly
indistinguishable from the original and yet uses about a fifth of the data:
10KB. The next image is even smaller - only 4KB - but visual artifacts are more
apparent (look near the edges of the petals or in the very center of the
flower). And the last image is again even smaller (2KB) but now the visual
quality is almost completely ruined.

When choosing a desktop image, be especially careful if it comes in a lossy
format like JPEG. Keep an eye out for visual artifacts resulting from
overcompression.

Compression artifacts aren't always a deal-breaker, however. If an image has
artifacts but is much larger than you need it to be, shrinking the image can
sometimes hide the artifacts completely. Intuitively, artifacts are a result of
not having enough information to fill the size of the image, thus reducing the
image size can actually improve the quality.
{: .note}

We're talking about compression of images here because I have a pet peeve for
ugly desktop backgrounds, but compression is a general tool that can be applied
to any sort of digital information. For example, ZIP is a popular lossless
compression format that works with any kind of data, and MP3 is a popular lossy
format for digital audio.

## Native Resolution ##

There is one last challenge when it comes to displaying digital images, and it
lies within your monitor itself. The pixels that monitors use to display images
are set in stone - there is no way to increase or decrease the number of pixels
that your monitor has. But this can make computer programmers' lives difficult,
because there are so many different monitors in the world and they all have
different numbers of pixels and thus different resolutions. In some cases, it
can be very hard for programmers to create programs which work well on every
monitor so instead they design their programs to only work with certain monitor
resolutions.

That could be bad news for monitor manufacturers, since some of their monitors
might not be able to run these programs that require a different resolution. To
get around this, most monitors have a feature to "fake" a different resolution.
For example, if a monitor has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and a program only
works with the resolution 1024&times;768, the monitor can fake the smaller
resolution either by displaying a small image with black pixels filling in the
extra space, or by resizing the small image to fit its actual 1920&times;1080
resolution.

The resolutions that your monitor can display (including the fake ones) are
called **supported resolutions**. Whereas the _actual_ resolution of your
monitor (which corresponds to the number of pixels it has) is called the **native
resolution**.
{: .definition}

Earlier we learned how enlarging digital images is usually a big no-no, so using
a non-native resolution for your monitor often is as well. You can go through
all the effort in the world to prepare an image to look perfect for the size of
your desktop, but if your desktop is then enlarged to display at a non-native
resolution on your monitor all of your effort is wasted.
