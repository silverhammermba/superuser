title: (BONUS) Digital vs. Analog
category: part1

All of that digital/analog/discrete/continuous stuff we learned in the
formatting chapter might have been a little too abstract. Let's break it down
with a real hands-on example.

## Wallpapers ##

Most computers these days have the concept of a "desktop": a main workspace
where you can store files or links to programs, and which is covered up by
the program windows you open (such as the web browser you are reading this in).

And all of these desktops have a pretty image for you to look at when you have
no windows open. These images are often called "desktop backgrounds" or
"wallpapers". You've probably seen some of the [default wallpapers][wall] that
come with popular computers. Kind of like your outfit at an interview, your
desktop wallpaper is one of the first things people will notice about your
computer and it says a lot about what kind of user you are. In fact, you can
usually quickly tell whether someone is _not_ a superuser just by looking at
their wallpaper. How? Well, surprisingly, it all has to do with that digital vs.
analog trickiness.

## Images ##

Last chapter I mentioned how monitors display images using pixels. Pixels are a
purely **digital** concept: you can count the number of pixels on your monitor,
and you can't have half a pixel. Similarly each pixel can only display a certain
number of colors, and there are certain combinations of colors they can't
reproduce exactly. However, we usually use monitors to convey **analog**
information: our eyes can't easily distinguish between tiny pixels or tiny
varitaions in digital color, so we perceive smooth images with smooth colors.

Understanding this gap between digital and analog is essential for having a
good-looking desktop wallpaper, and a trained eye can easily pick out when a
digital image is not being properly displayed on a monitor.

For this chapter, we're going to look at the image of this flower:

This image is made of a grid 158,464 pixels - 128 on each side.
