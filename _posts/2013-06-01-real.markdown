By now you should have a decent grasp of the theory behind computation and what
makes a computer a computer. But the tiny theoretical machines we've been
playing with are nothing compared to the fearsome computers we use in this
information age. How do those work? Unfortunately the answer is very, very,
**very** complicated. So we're going to skip over a whole lot of details (yay!)
because frankly most superusers don't know this stuff anyway and often don't
need to.

<aside class="note">
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't care about learning those omitted details!
Remember: every tidbit of knowledge about computers is of interest to a
superuser. Some tidbits are just more interesting than others.
</aside>

Virtually every modern computer is made of several interconnected and swappable
pieces. Each piece has a different responsibility. This is handy because if a
piece breaks or isn't working well, we don't need to throw out the whole
computer - we can instead swap out the offending component. For some less
important pieces, the computer might even continue operating in the event of a
failure.  Like so many other things, we have special computer lingo for these
pieces:

<aside class="definition">
The physical components of a computer are called the computer's **hardware**.
</aside>

This is in contrast to the other essential components of a computer:

<aside class="definition">
The programs run by a computer are called the computer's **software**.
</aside>

There is a huge variety of hardware available for computers these days, so in
this chapter I will focus on only the most common ones. Now put your hands
together as we welcome our players to the stage...

## Central Processing Unit ##

![CPU]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cpu.png)

Often called the "processor" or "CPU", this component is the beating heart of
your computer.  It performs almost every calculation of the computer, and it
does so at a mind-bendingly fast speed. The CPU is very much analogous to a
Turing machine. A Turing machine's memory is the tape on which it writes
digits; a CPU's memory is its "registers": a collection of numbers each with a
specific size (32 bit, 64 bit, etc.) and silly names like "EAX" or "XMM0". The
CPU performs algorithms by following instructions - just like a Turing machine.
An example of a CPU instruction might be "store the 32-bit value 0xF4285BC0 in
the register EAX" or "add the value in RBX to the value in EAX and store the
result in EAX". A Turing machine has a moving head to perform the algorithm's
instructions; in a CPU the equivalent component is called the "core". Many
modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing the CPU to process several
instructions at once! Some of the duty of the Turing machine's state register
is performed by special registers in the CPU while other aspects of the state
are handled by other components (as we'll see later).

While a Turing machine only accepts one type of instruction, CPUs have a wide
variety of instructions that they understand. This makes the design of the CPU
more complicated, but makes program design much simpler. The type of
instructions understood by the CPU vary by model and manufacturer. This means
that each program needs to be designed for a certain instruction set - and only
CPUs who know those instructions will be able to run those programs. This is one
of the big difficulties of program design.

CPUs are measured primarily in three ways: speed, parallelism, and memory. Speed
is by far the most valued quality. CPUs read instructions following a very rigid
timer called the "clock". The faster the clock speed, the quicker the CPU can
finish each calculation. But there are limits to the clock speed: set it too
fast and the calculations can become error-prone or the CPU can overheat and
damage its physical components. All CPUs come with the clock speed set at a safe
value by the manufacturer, but some risk-taking superusers choose to override
it. The usual measure of speed is hertz. A 1 hertz CPU can perform one program
instruction each second. An average CPU at the time of writing is clocked at
about 3.5 gigahertz i.e. 3.5 _billion_ instructions per second i.e. rather fast
indeed.

<aside class="note">
Technically speaking, a hertz is a "per second". So we should really say that
CPU speed is measured in "instruction hertz" i.e. instructions per second. But
no one says that. Ever.
</aside>

The second measure, parallelism, is just a count of how many cores a CPU has.
Four core CPUs (AKA quad-core) are becoming quite common these days. Parallelism
is a very appealling idea because you might think that it multiplies the speed
of a CPU: a CPU that performs four instructions at once will finish four times
faster. But the reality is less exciting. It turns out to be very hard to create
algorithms that still work when four instructions are processed at once, so many
programs simply ignore additional cores and only use one core at a time. Still,
we're getting better at taking advantage of multiple cores so single core CPUs
are becoming less common.

The final measure, memory, is mentioned much less often but is still crucial.
With our Turing machines, we were allowed to have as much imaginary tape as we
wanted, which was convenient but unrealistic. With a CPU, the number and size of
available registers is set in stone and the total capacity is not very large. To
help with this, most modern CPUs have a "cache" - an extra chunk of memory
(usually a few megabytes) for storing additional information. The limitation
of the cache is that it can _only_ store information. If we want to use a number
in the cache for a calculation, it must first be transferred to a register. This
makes using the cache slightly slower than the registers, but the extra size
makes it worth it.

## Random Access Memory ##

![RAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ram.png)

Often called just "memory" or "RAM", this component stores most of the
information needed while your computer is in operation. Compared to the size of
the registers and cache of the CPU, the RAM is massive - usually measured in
gigabytes (remember, that's _billions_ of bytes). However, accesing information
in the RAM is even slower than accesing the CPU cache. But again, the increase
in storage capacity makes it worth it. The RAM is where the programs are stored
before the CPU performs them, and it also performs much of the duty of the
Turing machine's state register, keeping track of the state of the programs
as the CPU does all the work.

You might be wondering what is "random" about the RAM. Imagine the information
in your computer as a bunch of books. The CPU reads the books in order to do its
work, but it can only hold a few books at a time. In this analogy, the RAM is
like a big bookshelf. What happens when the CPU needs its copy of "The Golden
Compass"? The computer could find it by starting at one end of bookshelf and
running its finger along each spine until it spots the requested title. This
would be what computer scientists call "sequential access" - the computer
looking at each book _in sequence_ in order to find a specific one. But
sequential access is slow; the more books you have, the longer it takes to find
a particular one. If the CPU needs a lot of books at once, it can only get them
quickly if they happen to be near each other. RAM is a much more clever
bookshelf. It is designed in such a way that the CPU could start calling out
book titles _randomly_ and the RAM would be able to retrieve them just as
quickly as if they were all sitting together at the front end of the bookshelf.

RAM is easy to measure: you want a lot of it (about 4-16 gigabytes at the time
of writing) and you want it to be fast.

Now the RAM has one big deficiency: it's _volatile_. That means it can only
store information while it is powered by electricity. To continue the previous
analogy, the RAM is like a bookshelf _without the shelf_. When the CPU hands
over its copy of "The Amber Spyglass", the RAM dutifully puts it in place, and
it immediately starts falling to the floor. But the RAM is so very speedy that
it can grab each book before it hits the ground and put it back in place, over
and over again while your computer is running. But as soon as your computer is
powered off they all clatter to the floor and that beautifully organized
information is lost.

But what about all of your personal files? Your don't lose all of them when you
turn off your computer. Where are they stored?

## Hard Drive ##

People these days have a lot of data. Music, movies, and games can quickly add
up to be hundreds of gigabytes of information - far too large to even store in
your RAM (ignoring the problem of volatility).  To solve this problem, we need
large, persistent data storage. The hard drive fills this role.

There's some confusing terminology here, and to understand we need to quickly
recount the history of data storage. In days of yore, it was common for personal
computers to store information on flexible magnetic disks. By spinning the disk
around, the computer could read information from different portions of the disk.
For example you would store a program on such a disk, plug it into your
computer, and the program would be transferred to your RAM for the CPU to read.
These disks were affectionately referred to as "floppy disks" and they were
cheap but couldn't store much information. Often we had to break data down into
smaller chunks and store them on several floppy disks, which was a major
inconvenience.

The situation improved with the creation of hard disks. These were magnetic
like floppy disks, but made of thick metal and were capable of storing much
more information. Hard disks could store essentially as much information as you
could want but were larger and more complex. Because of this, hard disks were
usually used as permanent fixtures in computers rather than swapped out
frequently like floppy disks. The motorized components that drove the spinning
of the disk and read and wrote information to and from it were included with the
disk as a single package. Hence, these storage devices were called "hard disk
drives" or "HDD"s for short.

Similar to the story for RAM, it is even slower to read and write data to a HDD
but the huge increase in storage capacity makes it worth it. By now you might
notice a pattern:

Registers &rarr; Cache &rarr; RAM &rarr; HDD

Each transition trades speed of access for increase in capacity. This is one of
the biggest differences between a theoretical computer like a Turing machine and
a real computer. In theory, a computer only needs a single type of memory - but
by having multiple types with different speeds and capacities we can make
computers run faster and more efficiently.

And since we're always searching for faster ways of doing things, HDDs are
currently on their way out of the door. The replacements are called solid-state
drives or "SSD"s. They perform the same duty as HDDs, but are physically
smaller, require less electricity to operate, and operate much, much faster.
SSDs also don't use disks or have motors and moving parts like HDDs do. However,
despite SSDs' growing popularity, it is still common to refer to the permanent
storage device in your computer - regardless of its type - as the "disk" or
"hard drive".

## Motherboard ##

All of these components need to be able to communicate in order to transfer data
between them. The motherboard or "mobo" fills this role. Motherboards have a
variety of connectors to which the CPU, RAM, hard drive, and other computer
peripherals attach. The CPU connector, or "socket", is often the most important.
While the RAM and hard drive connectors are generic enough to work with a
variety of models, the CPU socket usually restricts your choice of CPU to only a
few types.

Additionally, the motherboard contains the simple programs and data required to
start your computer. These programs recognize all of the components attached to
your computer and initiate the loading of more complicated programs and data
from the hard drive.

<aside class="definition">
The programs stored on the motherboard that control and initiate the other
computer components are called the **Basic Input/Output System** or **BIOS**.
</aside>

Because the motherboard mostly acts as a middleman between more complicated
components, it is often the cheapest part to buy. But its central role also
means that a faulty motherboard is one of the more problematic issues a computer
can have. 

## Other Components ##

The components mentioned so far are what I would call the "essential" components
of a computer. You will find them in almost every computer. However there are a
number of additional components that many modern computers to have.

### Monitor ###

Often called the "display" or "screen", the monitor provides a means for the
computer to create digital images. All monitors display images using a grid of
tiny pixels.

<aside class="definition">
A **pixel** is a square with a solid color.
</aside>

If the pixels are small enough, our eyes lose sight of the grid and it
becomes possible for monitors to display images that look smooth. If the monitor
can change the color of the pixels quickly enough, a series of images can be
displayed as an animation - much like a flipbook.

Monitors can vary in many ways:

* The size of the monitor (usually bigger is better)
* The number of pixels (more is better)
* The size of the pixels (smaller is better)
* The number of colors that each pixel can have (more is better)
* The range of color that each pixel can have (e.g. some monitors can display
  darker or lighter colors than others)
* How quickly each pixel can change color (faster is better)
* The type of connections the monitor can use to connect to the rest of your
  computer

### Graphics Processing Unit ###

Often called the "graphics card" or "GPU", this component is specifically
designed to provide image data to the monitor. You might find it odd that such a
specific component exists, but consider the example of typing an e-mail on the
computer. We expect to be able to press a key on the keyboard and for the letter
to instantly appear on the monitor. Humans are perceptive enough that if it
takes more than a few hundredths of a second for the letter to appear after
pressing the key, we notice the delay - and this can make the computer very
frustrating to use. Consequently, your computer is constantly racing to quickly
display images on the monitor before you notice - in addition to all of the work
it's doing to run your other programs. For demanding tasks like simulating
three-dimensional scenes or displaying high-detail videos, the CPU can have a
hard time keeping up with the workload.

The GPU makes life easier for the CPU by taking over all image-related
processing. It's basically a separate computer inside your computer, with its
own CPU and RAM - both of which are specially designed to quickly perform the
most common calculations required for producing digital images. The GPU's
complexity can make it one of the most expensive components of the computer.

### Sound Card ###

Much like the case of the GPU and the monitor, the sound card provides audio
data to the computer's speakers - allowing for near-instantaneous audio
responses to our actions. However, due to the relative simplicity of audio
processing and the rising power of CPUs, it is becoming more common for the
motherboard to include its own speaker connections and for the CPU to perform
all audio-related computation.

Dedicated sound cards these day are mainly useful for audio engineers or those
with advanced computer speakers.

### Network Interface Controller ###

The ability for computers to communicate with each other is kind of a big deal
these days. This component, often called the "NIC", "network adapter", or "LAN
adapter" (LAN being a specific type of network), facilitates such communication.
It provides the connection with the network - which could be a plug for a wire
or an antenna for wireless networks - as well as hardware for decoding and
interpreting the information received over the network.

With the ubiquity of computer networking and the increased power of CPUs, it is
becoming more common for the motherboard to provide its own network interface
and for all network-related computation to be performed by the CPU.

### Universal Serial Bus ###

This one isn't actually a component at all, it's a standard. But you're probably
already familiar with it from its acronym: USB. In the dark ages of computers,
there was very little standardization among computer components. There were more
specialized cables and connectors and things were generally not very
interchangable. With USB, several computer companies collaborated to create a
computer connection that would be generic enough to work for a variety of
purposes. These days every motherboard comes with at least a couple USB
connectors and USB is used to connect keyboards, mice, webcams, printers,
joysticks, hard drives, phones, cameras, and anything else that doesn't have
demanding technical requirements.

These components can be absolutely crucial for a computer (especially the mouse
and keyboard) but there isn't a whole lot to say about them.

### Periperhal Component Interconnect ###

While USB is the standard for connecting external components to your computer,
the peripheral component interconnect or "PCI" connection is the generic
connector for additional internal components. So while the CPU, RAM, and hard
drive all use specialized connectors, the GPU, sound card, NIC, and a variety of
other computer components use PCI.

Technically speaking, PCI is the name for an older, now-obsolete connection.
It's replacement - peripheral component interconnect express or "PCIe" - is now
ubiquitous, so we can still get away with calling it just PCI.
