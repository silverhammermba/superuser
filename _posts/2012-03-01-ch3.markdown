In the previous chapter, I mentioned the large number of application protocols
that exist. You probably make use of many such protocols when you use the
Internet, but in this chapter we're going to focus on the king of application
protocols: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Remember that thanks to the transport and Internet layers, we don't have to
worry at all about the technical details we discussed in the previous chapters.
When discussing the application layer, we can pretend that computers magically
send formatted data to each other just as easily as you might talk to another
person in the same room as you.
{: note}

You might know good ol' HTTP from your browser's address bar, where it is often
seen just ahead of the domain name. That's because HTTP is the backbone of the
_World Wide Web_: the interlinked multimedia web pages you view in your web
browser.
