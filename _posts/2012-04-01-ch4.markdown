In the last chapter we talked about how HTTP sends HTML documents to your
web browser, which interprets them to create web pages. This chapter focuses
more on that incredible piece of software: the web browser.

Your web browser is a program running on your computer. It has the enormous
responsibility of constructing web pages from HTML documents. Why is that such a
big responsibility? Well, consider the wide variety of [tags available in
HTML][moz].

[moz]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

If an HTML document says

    <img src="./family_picture.png"/>

Your web browser needs to display a picture on your screen. If a document says

    <input type="date" name="Birthday">

Your browser needs to provide some interface on your computer screen for picking
a date (my browser draws a little calendar that I can click on). If it says

    <form method="post">

Your browser needs to create a form for you to fill out and - when you've
finished - package up your data and send it across the internet using HTTP. If
it says

    <video src="home_movie.ogg">
      <track kind="subtitles" src="home_movie.en.vtt" srclang="en" label="English">
    </video>

Your browser needs to be able to play a video with subtitles! If HTML says
"Jump!", your browser says "How high?"

If your web browser is not very well made, it might not understand some of these
tags and will simply ignore them - possibly impairing your experience of the web
page. Or it might understand the tag but do a poor job of interpreting it; for
example, at the time of this writing many browsers don't provide a simple
interpretation of `<input type="date">` and make you type in a date yourself
rather than presenting a calendar for you to choose from.

Since the way a web page appears and functions depends on the browser
constructing it, choosing a good web browser to use on your computer is a very
important choice.

## Choosing Software ##

There are many different web browsers available on the internet, so how do you
choose the best one to use? This is a general problem that superusers often
face: how to choose the right software for a job when several pieces of software
all work? And that question is just a twist on the even more general problem:
how do you choose the best solution to a computer problem when there are
multiple options?

Let's focus on just the matter of choosing software. Before we solve this
problem, let's think about _why_ we need to choose carefully.

1. Technology standards change. In 2008 the standard describing HTML was
   significantly updated, adding new responsibilities for web browsers to handle
   in order to create web pages. These responsibilities continue to change over
   the years. Old web browser software can't handle some of these new changes,
   causing some web pages to function or appear differently than the authors
   intended.
2. Flaws are often found in software. As you now know, the Internet is a
   complicated, layered beast. Tiny, unintentional problems can pop up in these
   layers because of poorly designed software or even poorly thought out
   technology standards. Newer software often fixes such issues.
3. The Internet is important. If you're an average Internet user these days,
   chances are that you make credit card purchases online, manage a public
   identity on at least one social networking site, access private
   correspondance like chat and e-mail, and maybe even control a bank account.
   When you log in to each of these Internet services - before any information
   goes out into the Internet - you put your personal information into your
   browser. If some malicious programmer created your web browser, they might be
   misusing your personal information! For software so deeply intertwined with
   your personal life, it's important to get it from a source that you trust.

Luckily from this motivation we get these simple guidelines:

1. Get your browser from a well-known source
2. Keep your web browser up to date by periodically downloading the latest
   version

There are only a few web browsers that satisfy number 1. All of these browsers
are free of cost and work very well. Which one you choose is largely a matter of
personal preference so feel free to try out a few.
