title: For Matt
---

Last chapter we learned that computers store information in binary, broken up
into 8-digit bytes. So "information", to a computer, is really just a bunch of
numbers. But obviously the computers we know can do much more than work with
boring old numbers. They can edit photographs, play music, let us interact with
stunning games, show us animations and videos, and basically anything else you
can think of. It seems like a huge gap exists between simple binary numbers and
the multimedia we interact with.

TODO describe file formats and data sizes. But does this even fit here? We just
need to know Mb, Gb, etc. before the real computers chapter...
