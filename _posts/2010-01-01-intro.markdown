This is a book for people who find computers mysterious or confusing. I want to
teach you the basics of computers in order to demystify them. With how important
computers are to our modern way of life, it is important to have more people
around who are comfortable with them.

First a disclaimer: this book is not written for [complete idiots][ci]
or [dummies][du]. Computers are tricky things, and you will need some cleverness
and determination to get through this. However, you won't need any fancy diploma
or prior knowledge to understand this book. I try my best to explain all
concepts and terminology before using them.

Still reading? Great! By starting to read this guide you have demonstrated that
you have what it takes understand computers. A healthy thirst for knowledge and
the willingness to read long, boring documents are the secret skills for
becoming good at computer use. I'll do my best to keep things interesting so
long as you try to stay thirsty for knowledge.

## How to Read This Book ##

This guide is broken into four parts and is not yet complete.

1. Computers: learn about the fundamentals of computation and how modern
   computers work.
2. The Internet: learn about how computers communicate with each other, the
   basics of computer security, and the mechanisms that make the Internet tick.
3. Computers in Depth (incomplete): learn how to install and customize an
   operating system, and create your own software.
4. The Internet in Depth (planned): learn about the internals of web
   applications

These parts build upon each other and are written to be read in order, but if
you have a particular interest you can easily skip forward to a specific chapter
using the list of chapters at the top.

## Notation ##

Occasionally you'll see little highlighted blurbs like these.

**Definitions** highlight terms that are important to understand. Pay close
attention! All definitions from the chapters (and a few more) are listed in the
[glossary][gl].
{: .definition}

Notes are little reminders. They might remind you of older material that is
being used again or they'll try to clear up a frequent point of confusion.
{: .note}

"Thinking deeper" blurbs set aside optional material. Sometimes I think of
something related to the current chapter that isn't essential for your
understanding but is just too cool for me to not mention. Don't feel bad about
skipping over these if they go over your head.
{: .deeper}

Most chapters have a few exercises at the end to help you grasp concepts from
the chapter. They're not graded, but you should still consider them. And yes
there are selected answers [in the back][ans].

Sometimes you'll see text highlighted in `pink` or

    set aside in a big gray block.

This generally indicates that this is "computer text". Such text might be typed
verbatim into a computer or a computer might output such text as the result of
some operation. Occasionally I <kbd>Insert</kbd> text highlighted in black to
refer to the physical keys on your computer's keyboard (e.g. the "Insert" key).

Some chapters are marked as (BONUS). Think of these chapters as big "thinking
deeper" sections. They build off of ideas from previous chapters or discuss side
issues which aren't essential for understanding later sections. You can skip
them if you like, but I think they're pretty cool!

<section id="issue">
## A Minor Issue ##

Occasionally in the book I use some fancy tricks to change the content based on
what kind of device you are reading it with.
<span class="mobile">You are seeing this section because it looks like you are
using a mobile device. While mobile devices like smart phones are technically
computers, they aren't the sort of computers this book is focused on.</span>
<span class="unknown">You are seeing this section because I could not figure out
what sort of device you're using! Sorry.</span>

<span class="mobile">That being said, 99% of the book should still be
informative. Just feel free to ignore stuff that doesn't make sense for the
particular device you are using. If you are _not_ using a mobile device, please
[let me know][faq] so that I can fix my book!</span>
<span class="unknown">The book should still be 99% useful, but please [let me
know][faq] about your device so that I can fix my book! For now the book will
assume that you are reading this with Windows Internet Explorer.</span>

So anyway...

## What is a Superuser? ##

On a computer system, the superuser is the one user with complete control over
the system. You might not realize this, but chances are that on the very
computer that you are using to read this guide there is information you cannot
access and tasks you are not allowed to perform. That is because you are a
regular user rather than a superuser. And for good reason! Certain information
on your computer is extremely sensitive. If the information becomes corrupted
you could lose your personal data, crash the computer, or even cause
irreversible damage to it! The superuser has no restrictions when using the
computer, which means an ignorant superuser can easily cause serious damage to a
computer by acting carelessly. On the flipside, a superuser can tweak and tailor
a computer's every behavior to suit her needs. Since the superuser has no
restrictions, she also has the most responsibility.

Technically speaking, it is quite trivial to become the superuser on your
personal computer. But being able to handle the burden of being a superuser is
another matter entirely. When I say that this book will help you "become a
superuser", what I mean is that it will help you acquire the knowledge and
skills necessary to be a responsible, benevolent one. In order to be a good
superuser, you need to have a solid understanding of how computers work and the
various systems involved in their operation. When you understand your computer,
you are better able to operate it as the superuser without causing harm.

There are many skills that I consider essential to being a superuser. You will
pick up most of them as you read through this guide, but here are a few to
get you started:

* A superuser is always thirsty for knowledge. Every tidbit of computer
  knowledge is of interest to a superuser&mdash;though some tidbits are of more
  interest than others.
* RTFM (three of the letters stand for Read The Manual). It is often tempting to
  seek out an expert to answer your computer questions, but it is essential that
  a superuser be able to acquire knowledge on her own. Just about every bit of
  technology in the world has an associated manual, and most are available for
  free, though they are sometimes not easy to find nor easy to read. Many
  experts on the Internet will refuse to answer a question if it's clear that
  the asker made no effort to figure it out on their own first.
* A superuser learns by doing. You can read as much as you want about computers
  and technology, but you haven't learned a thing until you get down and dirty
  at a keyboard to apply the concepts yourself.

That should be enough to get us started. Now let's get excited! What benefits
are there to being a true superuser?

* A superuser is her own tech support. You can save time and money by fixing
  your own problems.
* A superuser is a safer user. 99% of the dangers of computer use are spawned
  from laziness and ignorance. The more you understand your computer, the more
  you will be able to protect yourself and it from cyber threats.
* A superuser can tweak and specialize a computer to perform a wider variety of
  tasks, to operate more efficiently, and to better fit her needs. As a true
  superuser, your computer will feel like your room: all of your favorite things
  at hand, your possessions precisely arranged for ease of access, pleasing
  decor, comfort, familiarity, etc.

By now you are hopefully excited. If not, consider taking an invigorating walk.
We begin with Part 1.
