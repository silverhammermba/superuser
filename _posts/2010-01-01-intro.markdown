This is a book to set you on course to becoming an accomplished computer user
or -- as I like to call it -- a superuser.

First a disclaimer: this is not a complete idiot's guide nor is it written for
dummies. Computers are tricky things, and you will need some cleverness to get
through this. However you should not need any special knowledge or prerequisites
to understand this book. I will try my best to explain all concepts and
terminology before using them.

Still reading? Congratulations! By starting to read this guide you have already
set yourself apart from so many simpletons out there. A healthy thirst for
knowledge and the willingness to read long, boring documents to acquire said
knowledge is an important trait of any superuser. I'll do my best to minimize
the boringness so long as you keep up the knowledge thirstiness.

## How to Read This Book ##

This guide is broken into four parts and is not yet complete.

1. Computers: learn about the fundamentals of computation and how modern
   computers work.
2. The Internet (not complete): learn about how computers communicate with each
   other, the basics of computer security, and the mechanisms that make the
   Internet tick.
3. Computers in Depth (planned): learn how to install and customize an
   operating system, and create your own software.
4. The Internet in Depth (planned): learn about the internals of web
   applications

These parts build upon each other and are written to be read in order but if
you have a particular interest you can easily skip forward to a specific
chapter using the list of chapters at the top.

## Notation ##

Occasionally you'll see little highlighted blurbs like these.

**Definitions** highlight terms that are important to understand. Pay close
attention! All definitions from the chapters (and a few more) are listed in the
[glossary][gl].

Notes are little reminders. They might remind you of older material that is
being used again or they'll try to clear up a frequent point of confusion.
{: .note}

"Thinking deeper" blurbs set aside optional material. Sometimes I think of
something related to the current chapter that isn't essential for your
understanding but is just too cool for me to not mention. Don't feel bad about
skipping over these if they go over your head.
{: .deeper}

Most chapters have a few exercises at the end to help you grasp concepts from
the chapter. They're not graded, but you should still consider them. And yes
there are selected answers [in the back][ans].

## A Minor Issue ##

Occasionally in the book I use some fancy tricks to change the content based on
what kind of device you are reading it with.
<span class="mobile">You are seeing this section because it looks like you are
using a mobile device. While mobile devices like smartphones are technically
computers, they aren't the sort of computers this book is focused on.</span>
<span class="unknown">You are seeing this section because I could not figure out
your specific device!  Sorry.</span>

<span class="mobile">That being said, 99% of the book should still be
informative. Just feel free to ignore stuff that doesn't make sense for the
particular device you are using. If you are _not_ using a mobile device, please
[let me know][faq] so that I can fix my code!</span>
<span class="unknown">The book should still be 99% useful, but please [let me
know][faq] about your device so that I can fix my code! For now the book will
assume that you are reading this with Windows Internet Explorer.</span>

So anyway...

## What is a Superuser? ##

On a computer system, the superuser is the one user with complete control over
the system. You might not realize this, but chances are that on the very
computer that you are using to read this guide there is information you cannot
access and tasks you are not allowed to perform. That is because you are a
regular user rather than a superuser. And for good reason! Certain information
on your computer is extremely sensitive. If the information becomes corrupted
you could lose your personal data, crash the computer, or even cause
irreversible damage to it! The superuser has no restrictions when using the
computer, which means an ignorant superuser can easily cause serious damage to a
computer by acting carelessly. On the flipside, a superuser can tweak and tailor
a computer's every behavior to suit their needs. Since the superuser has no
restrictions, she also has the most responsibility!

Technically speaking, it is quite trivial to become the superuser on your
personal computer. Being able to handle the burden of being a superuser is
another matter entirely! When I refer to "becoming a superuser" in this book,
what I almost always mean is acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to be
a responsible, benevolent one. In order to be a good superuser, you need to have
a solid understanding of how computers work and the various systems involved in
their operation. When you understand your computer, you are better able to
operate it as the superuser without causing harm.

There are many skills that I consider essential to being a superuser. You will
pick up most of them as you read through this guide, but here are a few to
get you started:

* A superuser is always thirsty for knowledge. Every tidbit of computer
  knowledge is of interest to a superuser - though some tidbits are of more
  interest than others.

* RTFM (three of the letters stand for Read The Manual). It is often tempting to
  seek out an expert to answer your computer questions, but it is essential that
  a superuser be able to acquire knowledge on her own. Just about every bit of
  technology in the world has an associated manual, and most are available for
  free, though they are sometimes not easy to find nor easy to read. Many
  experts on the Internet will refuse to answer a question if it's clear that
  the asker made no effort to figure it out on their own first.

* A superuser learns by doing. You can read as much as you want about computers
  and technology, but you haven't learned a thing until you get down and dirty
  at a keyboard to apply the concepts yourself.

That should be enough to get us started. Now let's get excited! What benefits
are there to being a true superuser?

* A superuser is her own tech support. You can save time and money by fixing
  your own problems.

* A superuser is a safer user. 99% of the dangers of computer use are spawned
  from laziness and ignorance. The more you understand your computer, the more
  you will be able to protect yourself and it from cyber threats.

* A superuser can tweak and specialize a computer to perform a wider variety of
  tasks, to operate more efficiently, and to better fit her needs. As a true
  superuser, your computer will feel like your room: all of your favorite things
  at hand, your possessions precisely arranged for ease of access, pleasing
  decor, comfort, familiarity, etc.

By now you are hopefully excited. If not, consider taking an invigorating walk.
We begin with Part 1.
