Congratulations are in order! You've finished part 1, which means you have a
general knowledge of the workings of real computers and a better grasp of
theoretical computation than most self-styled computer geeks! You might be a
little frustrated by the lack of hands-on material in part 1, but trust me that
this sort of foundational knowledge is essential to your understanding when we
get to later material.

Next up, we're going to learn about the fundamentals of inter-computer
communication. You should be excited because after part 2, you're never going to
look at the internet the same way again.

That being said, part 2 (like part 1) is also mostly conceptual. If you
absolutely can't wait to get your hands dirty, you could skip ahead to part 3
where we'll revisit computers and I'll put you to work.
