Congratulations! By now you should have an understanding of the basic mechanics
that make a computer work. To top it off, you probably have a better theoretical
understanding of computers than most self-styled computer geeks.

might be eager to get to that part, but we need to lay a little more foundation
first. Next up: the Internet!
