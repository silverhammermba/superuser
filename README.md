Why I'm Making This Book
========================

It is my belief that while there may be a class of people who are incapable of
grokking computers, the size of this class is substantially smaller than the
class of people who currently struggle with computer operation. I think that
much of the confusion, frustration, and fear that laypeople can feel towards
computers stems from a fundamental ignorance of the machines' nature.

Even though the fundamentals of computation are conceptually simple and
ostensibly available to anyone with an internet connection, there is a sharp
difficulty curve to acquiring this knowledge. The difficulty comes from a
variety of factors:

* The popularity of "user-friendly" designs that obfuscate the inner workings of
  computers
* The emphasis on higher-level, practical dimensions (i.e. application/web
  design) that assumes (or ignores) understanding of foundational dimensions
* The abundance of technical terminology that distracts from the principles at play

For this reason, I decided to make a book that took an entirely foundational
approach to the topic of computers - a book that anyone with enough intelligence
and determination could use to break into the world of expert computer users. I
started writing with a few vague guidelines in mind:

* I will only introduce terminology when its presence is necessary, its
  definition understandable, and its purpose clear
* I will cover fundamental topics even if they are traditionally glossed over
  and simplified
* I will take as much time as necessary to cover a topic. I will write a book
  for people who are patient enough to learn
* I will not create a **complete** guide to computers, since the reader will
  need to learn self-reliance and be able to fill in gaps in their knowledge
* I will try to keep things interesting, fun, and well-motivated. The goal is
  for the book to be easy to read without dumbing things down too much and
  insulting the reader's intelligence
