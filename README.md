Why I'm Making This Book
========================

While there may be a class of people who are incapable of grokking computers, I
think that the size of this class is substantially smaller than the class of
people who currently struggle with computer operation. I think that much of the
confusion, frustration, and fear that people can feel towards computers stems
from a fundamental ignorance of the machines' nature.

Even though the fundamentals of computation are conceptually simple and
ostensibly available to anyone with an internet connection, there is a steep
learning curve to acquiring this knowledge. I believe this difficulty comes from
a variety of factors:

* The popularity of "user-friendly" designs that obfuscate the inner workings of
  computers
* The emphasis on higher-level, practical dimensions (i.e. application/web
  design) that assumes (or ignores) understanding of foundational topics
* The abundance of technical terminology that distracts from the simple
  principles at play

For this reason, I decided to make a book that took an entirely foundational
approach to the topic of computers - a book that anyone with enough intelligence
and determination could use to break into the world of expert computer users. I
have a few vague guidelines that I try to stick to:

* I try to introduce terminology only once the reader should have enough
  knowledge to fully understand it
* I try to cover fundamental topics even if they have little practical value.
  For example, my book starts off with a discussion of [Turing machines][tur].
  Not terribly practical, but essential for a fundamental understanding of
  computers.
* I try not to hurry. Computers are deeply complex machines, and it takes some
  patience to understand them.
* I try to resist the temptation to create a **complete** guide to computers,
  since the reader will need to learn self-reliance and be able to fill in gaps
  in their knowledge
* I try to keep things interesting, fun, and well-motivated. The goal is for the
  book to be easy to read without dumbing things down and insulting the reader's
  intelligence
