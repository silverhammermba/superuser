Bit
: A binary digit.

Byte
: Eight bits.

Computation
: A function that can be evaluated using an algorithm.

Evaluating a function
: Determining the output of a function given an input.

Format
: A description of how bytes are grouped together and what certain bytes or byte
  values mean.

Function
: A relation between input and output, where each input has at most one output.

Nibble
: Four bits.
: Half of a byte.

Program
: An algorithm that is read and performed by a computer.

Programming
: The process of inputting a program into a computer for it to read.

Turing complete
: The ability for a machine to simulate a Turing machine (and thus perform any
  calculation). A machine is a computer if and only if it is Turing complete.

Turing machine
: A simple, theoretical computer.
