Algorithm
: A well-defined, step-by-step process.

Analog
: Information which can be perfectly represented only by continuous data.

BIOS
: Basic Input/Output System.
: Simple programs stored in the motherboard which initiate other hardware and
  prepare the computer to run more complicated programs.

Bit
: A binary digit.

Byte
: Eight bits.

Checksum
: A function that accepts any number of bytes as input and outputs a fixed
  number of bytes as output.

Computation
: A function that can be evaluated using an algorithm.

Continuous
: Describes data which can only be measured.

Data
: Fact. Truth. Can be interpreted to produce information.

Digital
: Information which can be perfectly represented using discrete data.

Discrete
: Describes data which can be counted.

Evaluate
: For a function, to determine its output given input.

Format
: A description of how bytes are grouped together and what certain bytes or byte
  values mean.

Function
: A relation between input and output, where each input has at most one output.

Hardware
: The physical components of a computer.

Information
: Meaning. Can be encoded/stored as data using an appropriate format.

Internet layer
: The protocol in charge of getting data from one computer to another. In most
  cases, this is the Internet protocol (IP)

IP address
: A number uniquely representing a computer on a network for use with the
  Internet protocol. Most commonly 4 bytes long, though newer addresses have 16
  bytes.

Layer
: A protocol that allows for transmission of arbitrary data.

Monitor
: The screen of a computer, which displays images using pixels.

Nibble
: Four bits.
: Half of a byte.

Packet
: A format that wraps other formats, allowing additional information to be
  attached to the contained data.

Pixel
: A (small) square of solid color. Used to represent images digitally as on a
  monitor.

Program
: An algorithm that is read and performed by a computer.
: Software.

Protocol
: Defines rules for exchanging messages between computers, including data
  formats that will be used.

Programming
: The process of inputting a program into a computer for it to read.

Software
: A program or programs.

Transport Layer
: The protocol in charge of packaging data for transmission and unpacking it
  afterwards. TCP and UDP are protocols that are often used for this layer.

Turing complete
: The ability for a machine to simulate a Turing machine (and thus perform any
  calculation). A machine is a computer if and only if it is Turing complete.

Turing machine
: A simple, theoretical computer.
